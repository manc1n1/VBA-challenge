A Visual Basic Script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

As well as:

-  Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % Increase", "Greatest % Decrease", and "Greatest Total Volume".

-  Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
